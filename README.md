**Dataset Description**

The dataset contains information about customers of an e-commerce company. The objective is to predict whether a customer will churn or not. The dataset has 20 columns and 12,000 rows. The features include customer ID, tenure, preferred login device, city tier, warehouse to home distance, preferred payment mode, gender, number of devices registered, preferred order category, satisfaction score, marital status, number of addresses, number of complaints, order amount hike from last year, coupon used, order count, days since last order, and cashback amount.

**Insights Gained**

After analyzing the dataset, we can gain insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn. The analysis can help the company to improve customer retention and increase revenue. Some of the key insights are:

Customers who have a higher number of complaints are more likely to churn.
Customers who have not made a purchase in a long time are more likely to churn.
Customers who have a low satisfaction score are more likely to churn.
Customers who have a higher cashback amount are less likely to churn.

**Method Used**

To predict customer churn, we can use classification models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. The dataset can be split into training and testing sets, and the models can be trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. The performance of the models can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**Evaluation**

The models can be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the results are robust. The best model can be selected based on the evaluation metrics. The selected model can be used to make predictions on new data.

**Results**
The results of the analysis can help the e-commerce company to improve customer retention and increase revenue. By identifying the factors that contribute to customer churn, the company can take steps to improve customer satisfaction and address complaints. The analysis can also help the company to identify the most effective marketing strategies and promotions to retain customers.
